# Don-t-Touch-That-Thing
Ancient project from 2015 or so. It's a small dumb game where two players control two shiba inus and try to collect as many circles as possible, while also trying to not touch the thing in the middle. Made entirely with Java, compiled in Eclipse.<br/>

I'm not sure if you need anything special to compile it. I made this as a small test project years ago, and didn't concern myself with the details of the build path or required components to run the program.
